This week was the beginning of my Directed Fieldwork experience! It was spent creating the [Learning Outcomes Agreement](/dfw2024/learningoutcomes) and introducing me to the work that I will be doing for the rest of the quarter.

I arrived early and got to wander around Special Collections' New Years Potluck, where I got to meet (and re-meet) some of the staff working in that department. I will be working with Crystal Yragui, a Science and Book Arts Cataloger at UW Libraries, so we move between Special Collections and Cataloging and Metadata Services a bit.

 Part of this week was spent figuring out the details of where I will be doing this work. One day a week I will be working next to Crystal, and on those days we will be in Special Collections, but when I am unsupervised, I'll be on the third floor with Cataloging. Figuring out schedules and locations, alongside getting access to the necessary software, was a big priority this week. 

 Crystal showed me the station we will be working at down in Special Collections, although we didn't stay and work there because there were internet issues. I was also given a tour of the stacks, and the shelves where I could find the books I would be cataloging. 

To start with I watched and asked questions as we made our way through cataloging [The challenge of self-government](https://search.worldcat.org/title/44998568) and [Still life](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1082268422) (which can be [viewed online!](https://www.marlenemaccallum.com/shadows/1/)). This not only involved updating these records in OCLC, but it also involved updates to Name Authority records and submitting an LCSH proposal. There is so much to learn, from gaining familiarity with MARC fields and the specific rules and guidelines for describing book arts, to the software that is used to do this work. 

My work for the rest of the week involved getting software set up on my computer, lots of emailing to figure out the access I need in the library, and reviewing the many resources I have been provided with that will help me learn everything I'll need to know. This week was nerve-wracking to begin with but it has only made me more excited to learn and gain experience in cataloging this quarter.
