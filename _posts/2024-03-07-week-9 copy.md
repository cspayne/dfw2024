title: Week 9
---

It's my last official week of directed fieldwork. It's crazy how fast it's gone by but I feel like I've learned so much. I just took the time to go through the notebook I have used throughout this quarter, and I have over 20 pages of notes on cataloging artists' books. 
I started this quarter with zero cataloging experience. I had taken a cataloging class last year, but this only covered concepts and a few very basic MARC fields (I knew that 100 was a main entry field and that 245 was the title). I went from no knowledge to feeling confident creating and updating both bibliographic and name authority records, recognizing incorrectly used fields and subject headings, and knowing where to find the answers to my cataloging questions when they arose. 
I'll be writing a whole paper about my experience and what I learned, so for this blog I'll leave it at the two things that came up this week that Crystal and I decided where blog-worthy. 

1. Don't create note fields for information already in other fields (e.g. If your 041 already has $a eng $a nor, don't add a 546 just to say the book is in English and Norwegian)
2. When creating (or enhancing) a name authority file, it is the cataloger's job to address alternate access points (otherwise it is much less your responsibility, but you can if you're feeling generous)
